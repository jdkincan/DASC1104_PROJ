## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, message=FALSE}
dat1 <- read_csv("data/blkjckhands.csv")
dat2 <- read_csv("data/all_stocks_5yr.csv")
dat3 <- read_csv()
```

```{r}
glimpse(dat1)
```
```{r}
glimpse(dat2)
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r,  echo=TRUE}
open1 <- na.omit(dat2$open)
close1 <- na.omit(dat2$close)
rsi_dat <- dat2 %>%
  summarise(rsi = RSI(open1, n = 14, maType = "SMA"))
volatility_dat <- dat2 %>%
  summarise(vol = volatility(close1, n = 10, calc = "close", N = 260))
macd_dat <- dat2 %>%
  summarise(macd = MACD(open1, nFast=12, nSlow=26, nSig=9, maType= "SMA", percent = FALSE))
```

```{r}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
