      <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Technical analysis has long been a core component of Finance. However, only recently has this process become automated; and we have Data Science to thank. Machine Learning Algorithms, a type of AI, are now the backbone of our major financial institutions. (story about computing race)  Nearly everyone generating high profit in financial markets makes use of this technology. One of my long term goals is to build a live data algorithm that makes intelligent decisions on the fly. A big step towards achieving this goal is developing a trading strategy. A quantifiable trading strategy is the most important part of finance based ML algorithms and a key to understanding relative value in a market. Trading strategies tell a trader when to buy or sell based on a set of rules. The purpose of this strategy is to remove the emotional and impulse-based decisions that hamper so many traders. The data I will use to create this strategy was acquired from the user ___ on Kaggle. (LINK) It includes daily price and volume data for all companies listed on the S&amp;P 500. The data spans from February 2013 to February 2018. My hope is this strategy proves reliable in predicting stock price fluctuation (direction, magnitude, and velocity). I will test the strategy by comparing my percent gain/loss vs the S&amp;P 500 at large. (Compare percentages the run hypothesis test) The core questions (included below) will guide me as I build the strategy.</p>
<h2 id="core-questions">Core Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>How is a trading strategy built?</li>
<li>What is the optimal strategy with the indicators selected?</li>
<li>How much profit would I have made?</li>
</ol>
<p>Should time allow, I plan on completing this analysis as part of my final project.</p>
